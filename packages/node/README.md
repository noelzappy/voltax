# voltax-node

> The Unified Payment SDK for Africa.

**Voltax** unifies fragmented African payment gateways (Paystack, Hubtel, Flutterwave, etc.) into a single, standardized, and strictly typed API. Build faster, switch providers easily, and maintain less code.

## Features

- 🛡 **Strictly Typed**: Built with TypeScript + Zod for runtime validation.
- 🔗 **Standardized API**: One interface (`VoltaxProvider`) for all gateways.
- 🔄 **Adapter Pattern**: Swap providers without rewriting business logic.
- ⚡ **Lightweight**: Tree-shakeable, ESM & CJS support.
- 🔒 **Secure**: No hardcoded keys, enforced checks.
